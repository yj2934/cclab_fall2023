  <h2><span class="titleP2">Story</span></h2>
  <p>The little fish once lived happily with many other fish in these waters</p>
  <img src="p1.jpg" alt="">
  <p>However, one day, a <span class="highlightdeeppink">big pink fish</span> from another planet invaded and took over with <span class="highlightgreen">its men</span></p>
  <img src="p2.jpg" alt="">
  <p>The peace and harmony of life was broken</p>
  <p>Luckily, the little fish escaped undetected by hiding among the seaweeds</p>
  <img src="p3.jpg" alt="">
  <p>He was sad and determined to get his home back</p>
  <p>But once the <span class="highlightdeeppink">big pink fish</span> spot him, he would chase him and wanted to hurt him</p>
  <img src="p4.jpg" alt="">
  <p>The little fish could't beat the <span class="highlightdeeppink">big pink fish</span>, he was very upset. He did't know what to do</p>
  <p>A traveling <span class="highlightorange">crab magician</span> passed by one day</p>
  <p>The little fish happened to meet <span class="highlightorange">him</span> and asked <span class="highlightorange">him</span> for advice</p>
  <p>Knowing the little fish's sad situation, the<span class="highlightorange"> crab magician</span> decided to help him</p>
  <img src="p5.jpg" alt="">
  <p><span class="highlightorange">He</span> connected <span class="highlightblue">us</span>,<span class="highlightblue"> the players</span> who can help, with the little fish</p>
<p><span class="highlightorange">He</span> also gives the little fish magic, so that he can eat the <span class="highlightgreen">small green fish</span></p>
<p>The more <span class="highlightgreen">small green fish</span> he eats, the <span class="highlightpink"> stronger</span> he becomes</p>
<p><span class="highlightpink">He</span> gradually doesn't need to be afraid of <span class="highlightdeeppink">big pink fish</span></p>
<p>When <span class="highlightpink">he</span> eats enough<span class="highlightgreen"> small green fish</span>, he would becomes <span class="highlightpurple">strong enough</span> and can beat the<span class="highlightdeeppink"> big pink fish</span></p>
<p>Before the <span class="highlightorange">crab magician</span> left, <span class="highlightorange">he</span> created some magic bubbles to help the fish become stronger </p> 
<p>As <span class="highlightblue"> players</span>,<span class="highlightblue"> we</span> can see a larger area of the environment than the little fish, and instruct him to eat the <span class="highlightgreen">small green fish</span> and avoid the <span class="highlightdeeppink">big pink fish</span> that is pursuing him</p>
<p><span class="highlightblue"> We</span> can do it!</p>
